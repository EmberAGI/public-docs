# Lending and Borrowing

One of Emberâ€™s core capabilities is supporting lending and borrowing protocols across multiple chains. This allows users to interact with DeFi markets in a variety of ways, such as:

* Supply tokens to earn yield
* Use supplied tokens as collateral
* Borrow tokens against their collateral
* Repay borrowed positions
* Withdraw previously supplied tokens
