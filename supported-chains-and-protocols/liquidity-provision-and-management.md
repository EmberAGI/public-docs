# Liquidity Provision & Management

Ember enables users to participate in decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity pools, which are essential to automated market makers (AMMs). By contributing tokens to these pools, users help facilitate trading and, in return, earn a portion of the transaction fees. Ember offers intuitive tools to manage and monitor these activities. Key actions include:

* Supply assets to liquidity pools
* Withdraw assets from liquidity pools
* Discover available liquidity pools
* Track liquidity positions
