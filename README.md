# Getting started

Ember is an intent-centric, declarative layer for DeFi optimized for AI agent execution.

We provide a simple, comprehensive SDK to tap into all of DeFi leveraging our Action Graph and Advanced Workflow Library.

Specifically, we take high level action-goals, then parse, route, and construct executable transactions to achieve them, solving the agent<->protocol(s) problem.

Our SDK provides an abstraction layer that lets your agents seamlessly work with any LLM protocol or provider through a single unified interface, eliminating the need for protocol-specific implementations.

Developers can leverage our market data, social insights, and events infrastructure to build custom, in-depth DeFi strategies and workflows without having to focus on exact steps. Then, a single action is required to create an optimized, cross-chain execution of your intent.&#x20;

Our SDK is available in Rust and Typescript to be leveraged alongside RIG and Eliza, as well as traditional agent creation frameworks such as LangChain and LangGraph, AG2, CrewAI, etc.

Ember is built specifically for AI agent development, not retrofitted.

* **Built for LLMs:** Simple, well documented tool interfaces that let agents dynamically select and compose tools
* **Actions-as-a-service:** Instant access with wallet authentication. Pay-as-you-go, flat-rate crypto payments for usage.
