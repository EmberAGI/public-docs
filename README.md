# Getting started

Ember is an intent-centric, declarative layer for DeFi optimized for AI agent execution.

We provide a simple, comprehensive SDK to tap into all of DeFi leveraging our Action Graph.&#x20;

Developers can leverage our market data, social insights, and events infrastructure to build custom, in-depth DeFi strategies and workflows without having to focus on exact steps. Then, a single action is required to create an optimized, cross-chain execution of your intent.&#x20;

Our SDK is available in Rust and Typescript to be leveraged alongside RIG and Eliza, as well as traditional agent creation frameworks such as LangChain and LangGraph, AutoGen, etc.
