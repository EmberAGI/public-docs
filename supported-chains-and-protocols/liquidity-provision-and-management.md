# Liquidity Provision & Management

Ember facilitates participation in decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity pools, a cornerstone of automated market makers (AMMs). Users can contribute assets to these pools to enable trading for others and, in return, earn a share of the transaction fees. Ember provides tools to manage these activities comprehensively. Key actions include:

* Supply assets to liquidity pools
* Withdraw assets from liquidity pools
* Discover available liquidity pools
* Track liquidity positions
