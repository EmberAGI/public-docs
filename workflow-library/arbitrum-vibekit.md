# Arbitrum Vibekit

[Arbitrum Vibekit](https://ember-ai.gitbook.io/arbitrum-vibekit) is a powerful framework for building automated DeFi agents. It helps developers create on-chain agents that can handle a variety of autonomous tasks by combining both on-chain and off-chain data. Vibekit speeds up development by offering production-ready templates and examples that enables anyone to deploy custom agents within minutes. To see these capabilities in action, check out Vibekit's [example agents](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript/examples).

Ember serves as the core connectivity layer within Vibekit, powering its agent framework with access to DeFi protocols and on-chain services. By leveraging Emberâ€™s MCP interfaces, Vibekit agents can easily interact with a wide range of decentralized networks and data sources, making it simple for developers to build, deploy, and manage advanced DeFi automation without worrying about low-level integrations.
